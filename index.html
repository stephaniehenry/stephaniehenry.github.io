        <h2 class="aboutMe">About Me</h2>
        <p class="about">I’m a design student at Eastern Washington University, set to graduate with my Bachelors of Design and User Experience certification in June of 2020. Throughout my program, I have learned and become comfortable with the Adobe suite, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as UX principles and prototyping tools. I dream about doing UX work for games and gaming companies--both video and board. I’m currently in the early stages of setting up a Kickstarter campaign for the first game I’ve personally created. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

          <h2>Google Doodle</h2>

            <p>After learning how to animate SVGs using JavaScript in Web 2, I created a Google Doodle with the theam of“hamster”. I started by picking a topic and then collecting images to help guide my decisions. At first I wanted to do “gerbil” instead of “hamster” but quickly discovered that the tail was going to be tricky to include in the animation so I switched. I then collected the SVGs I was going to use for the project (credits in the GitHub ReadMe file) and brought them into CodePen, where I coded the doodle before moving the code into GitHub for hosting.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Google Doodle is pretty simple. The hamster just runs on its wheel infinitely. Ideally, I’d like another iteration of this project to make the hamster pause occasionally before it resumes running, but I haven’t figured out the right code to make that a reality quite yet.</p>          </figcaption>

            <p>Alliance of Adventurers is a card game for children ages 8-13 or so that draws inspiration from role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons. Initially, my goal was to produce a game children love and foster a desire to play traditional role-playing games. It has since evolved to have more focus on several 21st century skills, with particular emphasis on collaboration/cooperation, social, and literacy skills.</p>
            <p>Cooperation is the most important skill emphasized in AoA. Each adventure card is only possible to complete if all players contribute and help each other. So many board games are competitive, especially in this age group. The goal is to win. Of course, healthy competition isn’t a bad thing, but I felt games, especially kids’ games, are lacking cooperative play. In Alliance of Adventurers, each “storypoint” card has a power requirement, requiring red, yellow, blue, and green power. Some cards require more power of one or more colors than others. Each player also has “special ability” cards that allow them to boost their or their friends’ power. Unless you’re very lucky, most storypoints will require at least one special ability card in order to beat the card and earn the reward.</p>
            <p>Alliance of Adventurers is played with several sets of cards. The box includes four character decks with 20 cards each. Each character has a variety of power and special ability cards. Some characters have more power while others have more special abilities. There are also 12 storypoint cards, 5 easy and 7 medium, along with 4 finale cards and 4 creature companion cards. The box also includes 29 colored tokens to keep track of boosted power and a heads/tails token for certain special abilities.</p>
            <p>For more information, please go to the Alliance of Adventures website at (website domain goes here once I buy it and make the site--or I can just have the image link to the website like I did for the doodle)</p>

          <h2>Movie Trailer</h2>
           <a href="https://stephaniehenry.github.io/movie-trailer/">

            <p>This is the second version of my Movie Trailer website. For this project, I had to choose any movie--old, new, unreleased, etc--find a trailer for it, and create a website around it. I also had to use JavaScript to style the video player to match the art direction of the site. I choose the 2015 “The Peanuts Movie”.</p>
            <p>In my first iteration, I used the layout my professor provided and filled it with my styles and content. While the layout was functional, I couldn’t get the background image I chose--yellow with Charlie Brown’s stripe--to work responsively. Otherwise, it worked and looked okay.</p>
            <p>For version 2, the one you see here, I scrapped the background image in favor of a solid yellow background. As much as I liked the background image with the Charlie Brown stripe, I couldn't get it to cooperate responsively and decided the solid yellow conveyed the feeling I wanted on it's own.</p>
            <p>I also used one of Dan Davies' layouts (specifically layout 7) and modified it. Unfortunately, tablet view broke after I modified it (although desktop works mostly and mobile still works). I like the overall layout better than the original layout because it's more dynamic and interesting. There are still a few changes I would like to make to the layout, particularly concerning how the cast images are laid out.</p>
            <p>In version 3.0, I'd like to add an animated SVG of Woodstock flying around in the background. Originally I had wanted to add that to 2.0, but the CSS layout was giving me so many issues I didn't have a chance to try adding in an animated Woodstock.</p>
